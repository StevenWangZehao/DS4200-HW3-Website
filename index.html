    <h3>About me</h3>

    <p id = 'main'>Hello! My name is Zehao Wang. You can call me Steven. I am an undergraduate student at Northeastern University pursuing a B.S. in Data Science and Business Administration, concentrating in Finance. I'm involved in the Northeastern Electric Racing business team and the Systematic Alpha club. Currently, I'm pursuing knowledge in areas related to data science and finance. I am an international student coming from Nanjing, China. I finished my middle and high school in New Jersey. I have an elder sister who is 14 years older than me. Although all of my family members are in China now, my parents will visit me sometimes during the middle of semesters. I like playing tennis, golf, and video games in my free time. One specific topic I am interested in is Formula 1. My favorite racing team is the Ferrar and my favorite driver is Charles Leclerc. One of my favorite things on Sunday is watching the Formula 1 race with food and drinks with my friends. I am excited about the joining of Lewis Hamilton next year. As two of my favorite drivers on the grid now, seeing both of them on the same team will be fun and enjoyable.</p>
