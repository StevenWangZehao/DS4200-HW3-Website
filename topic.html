    <p id = 'main'>Formula 1 is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the FIA. Formula 1 uses a point system at Grands Prix to determine the annual World Driver Championship and World Constructor Championship. After the Azerbaijan Grands Prix, Oscar Piastri secured his win as McLaren took the constructors' lead from Red Bull Racing. It becomes possible for Mclaren to secure their World Constructor Championship this year, but the World Driver Championship is still unpredictable. In the American Grand Prix last weekend, Charles Leclerc, my favorite driver on the grid, won first place. His current teammate, Carlos Sainz won second place, which was an absolutely wonderful weekend for the Ferrari and Ferrari fans. In the last 10 laps, the competition between Red Bull Racing driver Max Verstappen and McLaren driver Lando Norris for third place was exciting because their driver points were very close to competing for the World Driver Championship this year. There was a strong argument between Red Bull Racing and McLaren fans about whether the five-second penalty to Norris was fair because both of them were out of track when Verstappen was defending Norris. Norris was in third place before receiving the five-second penalty in the last lap. The sudden change of result disappointed McLaren and its fans.</p>
